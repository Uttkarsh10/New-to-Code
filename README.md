A Blockchain application will be created that will work in 4 steps. After the first step of registration, the second step will consist of candidate information being provided to the voters of respective areas. This will be followed by 2 more steps, that is, voting and election results. This application will also ensure that no eligible voter will be left out to vote by warning them that their voter ID will be declared unofficial.
